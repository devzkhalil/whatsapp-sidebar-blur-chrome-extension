## Why did I develop this extension ?

I communicate with most of my clients at the office via WhatsApp.

Sometimes I have to discuss clients in office meetings, in front of my boss and colleagues,
where WhatsApp conversations and information are shared.

I also use WhatsApp to communicate with my wife, friends, and family,
so I don't want any personal information to be visible during productive meetings.
